# Code Descriptionvisi

## Code environment      
    - python 3.5       
    - Tensorflow 1.9         
## code content  
    - RapGenerator
        RapGenerator code is project code version 1.
    - Seq2Seq            
        Seq2Seq code is created by Mr Pang and more detail could be found in Pang's reopository.         
    - CharRnn             
        The input of CharRnn model is data given by teacher and it could bring a really general result.
    - crawler           
        This crawler is used for getting a lot of topic words from the first paragraph of Baidubaike webset.
        Initial search url is arbitry and result is stored as txt file in data folder.  
    - crwaler-single-topic
        This crawler is used for getting five topic words related given a word.
        input must be a single word and result is stored as topic_word.txt.
