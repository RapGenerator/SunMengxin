    - python 3.5       
    - Tensorflow 1.9         
## code content         
    - Seq2Seq            
        Seq2Seq code is created by Mr Pang and more detail could be found in Pang's reopository.         
    - CharRnn             
        The input of CharRnn model is data given by teacher and it could bring a really general result.
    - crawler           
        This crawler is used for getting topic words from the first paragraph of Baidubaike webset.
        Initial search url is arbitry and result is stored as txt file in data folder.
